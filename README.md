# Restaurant Roulette

Spin the wheel, go an adventure to the restaurant, & save time while creating countless memories on the short trek to the restaurant! Restaurant Roulette is a mobile app that will save a group of people tens of minutes of debate of where they will eat. A nearby restaurant will automatically be selected and basic information, such as its address and cuisine type, will be shown.  

## Description
The intended audience are a group of friends, collegaues, family members, or mere acquaintances that either want to avoid quarrelling over which restaurant they will eat at or experience the thrill of eating at a restaurant they otherwise would not have thought/known of. After spinning the wheel, click on the name of the restaurant. After doing so, information about the restaurant will be revealed. However, not too much information (it's a surprise ... 😮). Even more, you can only spin ONCE! 

The names of the restaurants on the wheel and information about the selected restaurant is displayed via the Yelp API. The mobile app was designed using Dart and very little Xcode. 

Solving <i>pressing challenges</i> within the friend group while learning new development tools/techniques!
